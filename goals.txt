My Personal and Academic Goals for Next Year 
In the coming year, I aim to strengthen both my personal growth and academic development. Personally, I plan to cultivate greater discipline, resilience, and balance by managing my time effectively and dedicating energy to meaningful projects that contribute to community impact. I also want to continue nurturing creativity and empathy in my daily interactions, ensuring that I grow not only as a professional but also as a supportive individual.
