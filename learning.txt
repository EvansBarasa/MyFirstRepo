What I have learned from this course.
One of the most valuable things I’ve learned in this course is how Git and GitHub work together to manage projects. Before, I thought version control was just about saving files, but now I understand that Git allows me to track every change, collaborate with others, and roll back if something goes wrong. Cloning a repository, editing files locally, and then committing and pushing updates has shown me how developers keep their work organized and synchronized across different machines. This process has taught me the importance of clear workflows and teamwork in software development.
